This repo is here only to host a dummy redirect page (index.html).

The redirect page uses a little hack to make an appropriately formatted anchor link available in a way that allows me to connect my Mastodon account to my Github pages in a way that allows it to be verified by Mastodon's connected account verification mechanism (see [Verifying your GitHub profile on Mastodon | Simon Willisonâ€™s TILs](https://til.simonwillison.net/mastodon/verifying-github-on-mastodon) which is where I found this trick).
